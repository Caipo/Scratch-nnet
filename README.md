# About 

A simple neural network coded in python using only numpy in order to better understand how neural networks work.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martininf1n1ty/mnist100. Hand written digets from zero to 99.

Activations: Currnetly the hidden layers use the sigmoid activation function and the output layer uses soft max activation. 

Loss: Using the cross entropy loss function.


# Results

Best out come wa with a accuracy of about 70%
