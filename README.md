# About 

A simple neural network coded in python using only numpy in order to better understand how neural networks work. This projects also has the abllity to change the height and width of the network

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martininf1n1ty/mnist100. Hand written digets from zero to 99.

Activations: Currnetly the hidden layers use the sigmoid activation function and the output layer uses soft max activation. 

Loss: Using the cross entropy loss function.

# Requirements 

Numpy and python v10+. Everything was coded in order to minimize imports

# Data set

A series of grey scale nunmpy arrays that corispoinds to handwritten numbers of 1-99.
Asci example 





# Results
My Best result was about an accuracy of 70%. I May try and optimize it in the future.
